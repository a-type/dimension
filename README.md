## A note on packages

Currently, `@dimension` packages are unpublished and awaiting a support ticket to see if I can get the NPM organization name. In the unlikely event that works, I'll publish them! Otherwise, I'll have to rebrand, which isn't a big deal considering no one knows about this project yet.

In the meantime, I'll try to keep my branding pretty neutral so as to not waste work... If you're interested in me publishing the library under a temporary package name I can do that.

## Getting Started

Right now, the only supported binding is React: [`@dimension/react`](./packages/react).

Check out the docs for that package to see how to use it.

## Repo Structure

This is a Yarn + TS monorepo in the pattern of [this post](https://juliangaramendy.dev/monorepo-demo/).

Yarn is required. I'm not so familiar with Yarn yet, but I'm learning. I'm using the "berry" v2 release.
