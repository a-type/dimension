# dimension
Seamless and intuitive keyboard selection for the web

## Getting Started

Right now, the only supported binding is React: [`@dimension/react`](./packages/react).

Check out the docs for that package to see how to use it.

## Repo Structure

This is a Yarn + TS monorepo in the pattern of [this post](https://juliangaramendy.dev/monorepo-demo/).

Yarn is required. I'm not so familiar with Yarn yet, but I'm learning. I'm using the "berry" v2 release.
