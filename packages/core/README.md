# @dimension/core

The core functionality of the Dimension DOM keyboard selection libraries.

This package contains the basic underlying logic, including tree-scanning, identification of selectable items, watching for changes, and index manipulation.

It also exposes some common keyboard utilities which can be used by other bindings.

For actual library usage, see the bindings ([`@dimension/react`](../react))
